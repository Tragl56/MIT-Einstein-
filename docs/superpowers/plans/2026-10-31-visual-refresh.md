# Visual refresh Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** Execute inline in the current session. Track completion below.

**Goal:** Improve OncoFlow visual hierarchy and consistency across Pro and Paciente.
**Architecture:** Preserve all existing API contracts and business rules. Apply scoped layout and presentation changes to the React components and shared stylesheet.
**Tech Stack:** Existing React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind 4 and Vite.
**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-31-visual-refresh-design.md`.

## Global Constraints

- Existing brand palette and Inter; no new package or backend changes.
- Keep demo, privacy, urgency and confirmation disclosures visible.
- Preserve responsive use, font preferences and reduced motion.

## Review Focus

Patient font enlargement; mobile navigation wrapping; long names and statuses; action buttons and forms; patient/pro view separation. Check in the browser; no new test framework for these presentation changes.

## Tasks

- [x] Record passing baseline lint/build and inspect original screens.
- [x] Refine scoped presentation styles, Pro shell, login and team composition. Files: `src/visual-refresh.css`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/Navbar.tsx`, `LoginView.tsx`, `EquipeView.tsx`.
- [x] Refine patient home and supporting surfaces. Files: `src/paciente/PacienteApp.tsx`, `src/paciente/telas.tsx`; add explicit presentation classes to existing components as needed.
- [x] Run lint/build; inspect desktop/mobile, check existing navigation and a patient-to-team request with fictitious data; capture previews; review diff for unintended business changes.

## Evidence

Baseline: `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed before edits. Work in fresh local clone on `codex/visual-refresh`, starting at `2e32798`. Network and Chrome require execution outside the Windows sandbox. No new runtime dependencies.

Final verification: `npm run lint`, `npm run build` and `git diff --check` passed. Browser checks covered patient journey, agenda, documents, check-in disclosure, urgency instructions, Lia request confirmation, team receipt/assignment/review, conversations, search and empty results, and arrow-key tab navigation. Pro widths 1440/768/390/320; patient widths 390/320 with 22 px font; login at 1440/390. No horizontal overflow in those checks. Reduced-motion preference disables the orb animation.

Visual review: final login, team and patient screenshots inspected. Existing domain limitations reported in the earlier analysis remain outside this presentation round; voice-provider calls and real hospital integrations were not exercised.

Implementation decisions: import presentation CSS directly from `main.tsx` because the development Tailwind import pipeline omitted the new nested stylesheet. Keep the displayed profile within filtered results (reproduced the previous mismatch and verified the correction); add keyboard navigation to the existing tabs. Backend and dependency manifests unchanged.
